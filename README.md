# MAGD-150
### 1. Lab 2  
 * Create a composition using shapes that could be interpreted to be either an 'planets / outerspace' or 'balloons' scene.
 * Create a canvasLinks that is a minimum of 128 pixels wide by 128 high.
 * Create a background for the canvas with a grayscale color value.
 * Use four different colors, at a minimum, in your sketch.
 * Use three of the following elements, at a minimum,  listed below:
   * Triangle
   * Quad
   * Arc
   * Curve
   * curveVertex
   * beginShape/endShape
   * beginContour/endContour
   * bezier
 * Use the following principles of design in your composition to the best of your ability:
   * Point
   * Shape
   * Symmetry (balance) or Asymmetry (imbalance) for the layout of elements within the overall layout
   * Color and Contrast
   * Organization or Grouping of separate elements by using the principles of Similarity, Proximity, or Continuity
   * Scale and Proportion
 * Check your p5 sketch for errors and do your best to fix them before turning in the assignment.  
### 2. Lab 4  
 * Create a canvas that is 400 pixels wide by 400 high (at a minimum).
 * Create a ball (a circle) that appears randomly on the canvas.
 * Have the ball move in the x- or y-direction.
 * Have the ball move in both x- and y- direction.
 * Have the ball restart once it moves off of the screen.
 * Have the ball restart in a new random spot when it moves off of the screen.  
### 3. Lab 6  
 * Create a canvas that is 400 pixels wide by 400 high (at a minimum).
 * Create and assign values to an array.
 * Use console.log() to show in the console the length of an array you created and assigned values to.
 * Create an array, then assign values to the array using a for loop.
 * Create motion using values from an array. Using a for loop, draw shapes  
   that include the array value as one of the position values for the shape, creating motion.
 * Set a value in the array to the a current mouse position value.
 * Check your code to catch errors and/or view console message from console.log() functions in your code.
